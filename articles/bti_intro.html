<h1>Building The Internet</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><font size="-1">Thursday December 29, 2022.</font>

<p>This is going to be a long series. Really, it's the kind of series that will never be complete, because there will always be more topics for me to cover, and in greater depth, no matter how much of this I get through. But it's something I've wanted to do for a while now, since I find networking fascinating and this is a good way to push myself to learn about these topics in detail and to figure out how to communicate them in an accessible way.

<p>The way this series is going to go is we are going to pretend we have been comissioned to build the internet. We're going to walk through it step by step, protocol by protocol. In certain cases we are going to mock up our own simplified version of things, just to get the core ideas across and get our hands on the keyboard, since I always find the best way to learn something is by building it directly, not just making use of it. Once we've got our simplified version down, we can jump over to the real thing and go from there, once we understand its inner workings. From that point on, it can be a black box to us as we move up to higher and higher levels of abstraction. This strategy won't always pan out, but where we can do it this way we will.

<p>I'm also going to do my best to ensure any code I write gets uploaded to github and that for any video I make, there's a corresponding article published on my website for it, which will likely rush through things a bit more than the videos though. Videos are great for coding through a problem, since they allow me to talk out loud about what's going on, and to evolve a piece of software over time in a way that makes sense, rather than throwing a giant wad of code at you and trying to sift through it with you. However, videos aren't suitable for everything. They aren't great for being able to skim through them for interesting points, and that's where articles serve a much better purpose. So, this series is going to be a combination of videos and articles, and I'll try to use the medium that feels best for the topic at hand.

<p>This is an ambitious project, and I don't have a ton of free time, so this is likely something that's going to be built up slowly. But hopefully things will be learnt along the way, the series will be valuable for someone, and eventually if you bear with me we will one day work our way up the OSI layers and get to places more practical for everyone.

<p>It's probably also worth noting that I'm going to be using Linux as my operating system for all of this. In particular, I'll be running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, or at least that's the OS I'll be running when this series begins. The code I write will be developed on linux and only tested against it. I will try to make it portable where I can, but that certainly won't be my focus.
