NAT

We will have 2 hosts at 10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3 behind a bridge br1 at 10.0.2.1
We will have another 2 hosts at 10.0.1.2, 10.0.1.3 behind a bridge br2 at 10.0.3.1
We will connect bridges br1 and br2 together with br3

We want to be able to send packets from the one "LAN" to the other.

might want to begin with only 1 host on each private network, so that we can just use IP. Then introduce a second host on each side and demonstrate how TCP routing works.


*==> First, we should set up a simple network like this, just so we understand how packets flow through it:
	veth1<==>veth2<->br1<->veth3<==>veth4<->br2<->veth5<==>veth6

	We should be able to get packets from veth1 to veth6 without much trouble. But let's just verify that is the case.
